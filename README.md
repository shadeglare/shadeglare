### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Max Koverdyaev.
Just a few words about me.

At the moment I'm an independent software architect and consulter. I worked in different domains including 
e-commerce, media, travel, digital healthcare, construction and management companies.

With over 10 years of experience in software engineering I have expertise in mostly all aspects
of development including architecture, implementation, deployment and maintenance of scalable digital services.

Sometimes I write to my [blog](https://shadeglare.medium.com).
