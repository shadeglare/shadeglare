Just a few words about me.

At the moment I'm an independent software engineer focusing on blockchain, web3, DeFi. Previously I worked in different domains including 
e-commerce, media, travel, digital healthcare, construction and management companies.

With over 10 years of experience in software engineering I have expertise in mostly all aspects
of development including architecture, implementation, deployment and maintenance of scalable digital services.
